# Smokeless Flame
This is a project I am starting to learn about C2s. Have been without power for a few days now and this candle next to me gave me the inspiration. It is so cold ...

The skeleton of this framework is based on my async-std-chat application. I will be removing druid from the code and likely implementing some other time of UI. Either just CLI or some other GUI platform. Maybe just using the browser. 

Just another learning project.
